## 🚀 Overview

This project serves as a go-to repository for commonly used **SQL scripts** covering a wide range of analytical needs such as:

- Time-based trend analysis
- Cumulative metrics and moving averages
- Part-to-whole comparisons
- Segmentation by customer, region, or behavior
- KPI calculation and visualization
- Data profiling and cleaning

Each SQL file is organized by a theme and documentation to make it professional and team-friendly.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Inspect structure, counts, and basic metrics from fact and dimension tables.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Perform month-over-month or year-over-year growth comparisons.
- **Cumulative Metrics**: Calculate running totals and moving averages for trends over time.
- **Segmentation**: Group and analyze data across demographics, geography, or behavior.
- **Part-to-Whole Comparisons**: Measure category performance against total (e.g., percentage contribution).
- **Reusable Queries**: Modular SQL for plug-and-play usage in dashboards and reports.

## How to Use

Connect your SQL IDE (e.g., DBeaver, SQL Server Management Studio, pgAdmin) to your relational database.
Load your tables similar to the ones referenced in the scripts (fact_sales, dim_products, etc.).
Open any .sql file and run it — each script is self-contained and commented for clarity.
Note: Scripts use standard SQL and ANSI-compliant syntax. Adjust minor differences based on your SQL engine (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, etc.).

## Example Use Case: Cumulative Sales Trend

```
SELECT
    DATETRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS monthly_sales,
    SUM(SUM(sales_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATETRUNC('month', order_date)) AS running_total
FROM gold.fact_sales
GROUP BY DATETRUNC('month', order_date);
```
