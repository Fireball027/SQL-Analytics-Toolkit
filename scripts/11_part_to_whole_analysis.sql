===============================================================================
Part-to-Whole Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To understand how individual categories contribute to the overall sales.
    - Useful for prioritization and decision-making (e.g., which categories to invest more in).
    - Can support A/B testing, regional comparisons, or business unit evaluations.

Features:
    - Comparison with previous yearâ€™s category sales to track growth trends.
    - Ranking of categories based on percentage contribution.
    - Conditional tagging (e.g., "Top Performer", "Moderate", "Low Performer").
    - Overall summary row added using ROLLUP.
